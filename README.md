# proaudio-gentoo

This is the mew generation proaudio overlay. It is based
on the old proaudio overlay on tuxfamily.org.

\< Work In progress >

Currently, I am cleaning up the mess in the old overlay.
When done, I will import the result here.

It is allready an attic with working ebuild (at the time
of their import) I don't have the time to maintain at:

Enjoy!
